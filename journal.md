First Update (Week 7):

I apologize that it has taken so long for me to update. A huge blocker for me these past few weeks has been finding a proper dataset or even any prior work regarding the topic that I was initially interested in pursuing (finding ways to track carbon emissions or detect ocean waste resulting from the production of fast fashion). After discussing with Professor Kucukelbir, I decided it was best to move to another subject and seek out papers which had associated code from workshop papers to see where I might be able to get a little bit of a start. 

I found an interesting paper regarding hurricane forcasting in 2021 Climate Change AI workshop papers and was able to find their source code and data set. This paper details a multimodal framework utilizing novel feature extraction as well as different ensemble methods to maximize performance. Not only are there many different aspects of ML being combined here, but it is mentioned that the authors believe this can be generalized to other satellite imagery datasets. I believe this will be a good place to start to see what other optimizations are able to be made, or even if there might be other datasets for which the novel feature extraction methodlogies can be applied.

Glad to hear about the new discovery. Would strongly recommend spending some time soon to catch up. A good place to start would be to replicate the results from the paper and see where you want to go from there.
